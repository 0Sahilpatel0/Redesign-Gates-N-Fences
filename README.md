## About The Project

The Gate N Fences Website is used to sell home entry gates and Fences but because of the poor UI of the website, users shifted to other websites 


## Major UI Problems

1. The bulk of data shown on the main screen
2. Unnecessary animations used
3. Didn't use familiar icons
4. The layout of the website is difficult to understand
5. Poor color combination



## Purpose Of Redesigning

The purpose of redesigning the Gates N Fences website is to
improve user experience so that users do not visit other websites
due to poor UI.
Give them a familiar experience when they used another shopping
website so they don't get confused while using the website with the
help of that the website usage also gets increased and it is
beneficial for both customers as well as the website owner.
